 **The structure** is very similar when a news story is viewed online (although it may also feature audio or video) so The use of headings and
subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information. for example structure added to a Word document to make it easier to understand.  so We use
structure in the same way when writing web pages.

**HTML code**  is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets â€” these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: **an opening tag** and a **closing tag** .
we note that in previos code  There are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag. **SO what is these Tags?**
Tags act like containers ,They tell us  something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
## Tags 
 here is some of main tags :
- The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code
- The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing </body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
- Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading.
- A paragraph of text appears between these <p> and </p> tags.
- Another sub-heading inside <h2> and </h2> tags.

**Attributes** provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element


## Body, Head & Title
- Body tag :Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
- Head tag :This contains information about the page rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window
- title tag :The contents of the title element are either shown in the top of the browser.
